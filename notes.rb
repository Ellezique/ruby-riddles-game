=begin #Command line - ARGV is a command line that stores an argument from terminal to use in the program.
ARGV[ ] is an empty array.when u run index.rb
in index.rb we might ask user to input thier name and puts it - to make it faster, we don't do anything in index. 
    Instead we have the parameter in ARGV["Gigi"]
ARGV[0] accesses "Gigi" to use in program
    if ARGV.length > 0 I have parameters. 
    else it is an empty array
        puts (what I would normally put in index.rb)

Documentation: You need to explain this to the user so they know to put it into command line.
